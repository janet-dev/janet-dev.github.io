        <h4>Janet Dornan - Portfolio</h4>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio and below is a collection of projects I have or am working on. 
          The site has been created to be mobile responsive, as the phone seems to be the primary device used by the population. 
          <br><br>This index (dot) html page is built using the Skeleton-2.0.4 - Responsive CSS Boilerplate. 
          Skeleton is ideal for a smaller project or if all the utility of larger frameworks is not required. 
          It only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and includes a grid, but that's often more than enough to get started. 
          <br><br>Light as a feather at ~400 lines and built with mobile in mind. Styles designed to be a starting point, not a UI framework.
          Quick to start with zero compiling or installing necessary. 
          <br><br>For more information please read the <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com">Skeleton documentation</a>
