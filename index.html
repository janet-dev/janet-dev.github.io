        <h4>Janet Dornan - Portfolio</h4>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio; below is a collection of my past and current projects. 
          To meet the needs of modern society, this site has been created to be mobile responsive. 
          <br><br>This index (dot) html page is built using the Skeleton-2.0.4 - Responsive CSS Boilerplate. Skeleton is ideal for smaller projects or if all the utility of larger frameworks is not required. 
          It only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and includes a grid, but that is often enough to get started.
          <br><br>Light and fast, at ~400 lines and built with mobile devices in mind. Styles are designed to be a starting point, not a UI framework. 
          Quick to start with zero compiling or installing necessary.
          <br><br>For more information please read the <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com" target="_blank">Skeleton documentation</a>
