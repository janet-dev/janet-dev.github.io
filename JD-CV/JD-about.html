                  I am Janet, also known as Paddy (from my time in the Army Reserves) or JD. I am highly motivated with excellent research 
                  skills, which enabled the building of a product-based website using self-hosted WordPress and marketing via social 
                  media sites. I have excellent administration skills, through the use of Microsoft Office, Open Office and Libre 
                  Office, as well as proficiency in using Windows, OS X and Linux. After completing a PGCert in Software and Systems 
                  Security (October 2018) and an eight week course in Web Development with Code First Girls (November 2020), I am now 
                  fully committed to expanding my knowledge to update my UI skills for the technology market. In the meantime, I am 
                  studying Python Programming, again with Code First Girls, until mid-April 2021. For the future I plan to continue on  
                  from JavaScript to study React and UI/UX Design at Udemy.
                  <br><br>
                  At age 18, I left Belfast to study in Aberdeen. Whilst there, I also worked part time in a town centre Chinese 
                  restaurant - this is where I picked up my love of international food. After university, I started my graduate 
                  training in Kidderminster with an industrial control company and remained in the industry until 2016. I specialised 
                  in designing, building, configurating and testing animated interactive industrial graphics. This career enabled me 
                  to live in a number of foreign countries including Germany, Netherlands and Nigeria. Furthermore, I worked as a 
                  contractor for high profile engineering companies such as Scottish Nuclear, BMW Rover, BP and Shell.
                  <br><br>
                  On my return to England, after three years (2012 - 2014) of living on Bonny Island in the Niger Delta region of 
                  Nigeria, it took some time to adjust to the lifestyle in the United Kingdom. During this time, I decided to expand 
                  into the field of technology, by increasing my understanding and broadening my skill set whilst taking part time jobs. 
                  I started with studying cyber security at university and now, due to lockdown, I have taken further time to 
                  explore and fine tune my skills. I am building my knowledge and learning my strengths by enrolling on different 
                  online software development courses. I am currently in the process of building websites for artist friends and using 
                  different frameworks (Bootstrap, Skeleton, React) depending on suitability.
