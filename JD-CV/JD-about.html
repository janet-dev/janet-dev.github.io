                <p class="card-text">
                  I'm Janet but also known as Paddy (from my time in the Army Reserves) or JD. 
                  I'm highly motivated with excellent research skills, which enabled the building of a product based 
                  website using self hosted Wordpress and marketing via social media sites. 
                  I've excellent administration skills, through the use of Microsoft Office, Open Office and 
                  Libre Office, as well as proficiency in using Windows, OS X and Linux. After completing a PGCert in 
                  Software and Systems Security in 2018, I'm now fully committed to retraining for my new career, 
                  whether it be at internship, apprenticeship or entry level (and would be happy with the associated 
                  salary). Meanwhile I am currently studying Python at Udemy and have completed (Nov 2020) an 8 week course in 
                  Web Development with Code First Girls, which included managing a project team of 4 for the production 
                  of a collaborative website - “Certificate of Excellence” was awarded. 
                  <br><br>
                  Many moons ago, I left Belfast at age 18 to study in Aberdeen and whilst there I also worked part time in a town centre 
                  Chinese restaurant - this is where I picked up my love of international food. After university I started 
                  my graduate training in Kidderminster with an industrial control company and never really left the industry 
                  until 2016. I specialised in designing, building, configurating and testing animated interactive industrial graphics. 
                  This career enabled me to live in a few foreign countries - Germany, Netherlands, Nigeria and work as a contractor 
                  for some high profile engineering companies - Scottish Nuclear, BMW Rover, BP, Shell.
                  <br><br>
                  After 3 years (2012 - 2014) of living full time on Bonny Island in the Niger Delta region of 
                  Nigeria, I returned home to England. Here I took a little time to readjust to UK life and I decided 
                  to start retraining in technology by studying several cyber security modules at university. 
                  Now I'm building my knowledge and learning my strengths by enrolling in different online courses - 
                  web development, python programming, SQL and data analysis.
                  <br><br>
                  Web development for me is an obvious strength, as the similarities with graphics building is very apparent. 
                  I'm now in the process of building a few simple websites for some artist friends, but 
                  I am also drawn to coding, database manipulation and data analysis - in fact I perform manual and weekly 
                  data analysis in my current role as a baker. I'm curious of what drives habits, how conditions affect sales, what 
                  the psychology is, how we can see patterns and predict outcomes.
