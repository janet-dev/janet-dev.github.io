      <p>
        Welcome to my journey as a newbie coder, while I clamber over this stony path to a new career.
<br><br>        
I'm Janet, an experienced industrial graphics engineer with an interest of solving technical problems. Highly motivated with excellent research skills which enabled the building of a product based website using Wordpress.org and marketing via social media sites. Excellent administration skills, through use of Microsoft Office, Open Office and Libre Office, as well as proficiency in using Windows, OS X and Linux. After completing a PGCert in Software and Systems Security, I'm now fully committed to retraining for my new career, whether it be at apprenticeship or entry level. Meanwhile I am current studying (or have enrolled to study) JavaScript, Python and SQL at Udemy.com.
<br><br>
I would now like to utilise these skills, as well as the experience gained from my years in the control industry, and undertake a new challenge as a software developer.
